# Ring3 Tools

This is a collection of small tools written in OCaml that I find useful
while working on XenServer toolstack components.

* chopchop - slides a window over a words in a file and emits each window 
* logfreq - analyses frequency of log lines in a syslog
* ring3fmt - expand tabs to spaces except at beginning of a line

# Building and Installing

    make
    make PREFIX=$HOME install

For now I'm keeping it simple:

* no `opam` or `oasis` files
* no manual page 
* no `configure` script
